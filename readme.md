# YOLO Based Document Layout Detection


### Introdctions
#### Business/ Use case 

This project intend to train the Yolo Model for detect and recognize different type of component in document. This object detection output can use for advance Document Automation Application


### Technology use in this project
1. Yolo Computer Vision Realtime Object Detection Model
    - this project used State-of-Art Pre-trained Yolo model for fine tuning the document layout detection 
2. Train Dataset
    - the project used open source documment layout dataset for training model

3. custom label image
    - use open source image labeling tools like : [cvat](https://www.cvat.ai/) , [roboflow](https://roboflow.com/)

### Installation and Setup
1. use requirements.txt for installation package dependencies

### Runming
1. dev folder : for testing tdifferent YOLO model with sample document/image

2. yoloTraing: for training custom model for document layout detection
